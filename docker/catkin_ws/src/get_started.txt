This first version weeble_bot followed the coding style from ECE439:
We have two nodes controlling the robot:
	motor_node and motors_command_node in motors package and weeble_bot package respectively

As you probably guessed, motor_node send the command to motor and let it spin, and motors_command_node takes the speed as input from userand passes those parameters to motor_node

To operate the weeble_bot,
	0. in a terminal, type "sudo pigpiod" -> This activates the gpio needed to control the motor
	1. in a terminal, type "roscore" -> This starts the roscore to enable controlling the robot by ROS
	2. in a new terminal, type "rosrun motors motor_node"
	3. in a new terminal, type "rosrun weeble_bot motors_command_node"
	4. input values ranging from -480 to 480 into terminal 3 to move the weeble_bot
